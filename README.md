WIP

# Dependencies
* Ruby 2.3.3
* yarn/npm

# Setup
```shell
bundle install
bin/yarn install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

# Development
To begin development, you need to boot up your Rails server and the Webpack
dev server which compiles all of your Javascript code:
```shell
rails s
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

# Client Tests
